👋 Hi, I’m bbe  - research enthuasiat, trained data scientist, love statitics Go CUSE !

- 👀 I’m interested in ... advancing health equity focus on marginalized youth through tech  

-- 👀- 👀  Adept building ontologies, informed with scientific research, to frame analysis + translate into structures  

-- 👀- 👀-  👀 ---> Love digital dust, dwell times, geolocations, content scatter, and nonsense  ✨✨

- I have alwasy been driven to social and info theory. check out my sociology papers on postmodernism, ULTRA-modern, marxist dead labor
- i left a masters in sociology bc of work out out state and no online or school near where I lived. I raised and trained horses and everything farm.

- in 2000 i wrote "all humans and systems are blended together through capitiamism's onslaught where computing tech taking control of the real. The real has been replaced by matrices, memory banks, command models, and operating systems functioning on intense levels of rationalization, perfect programming no human is alien from
- Question: how can we use perfect programming + control of the real + AI to establish policies for HEALTHY-AI ?

- If tech is now self-programming itself, has endless GPUs and storage, and Amazon Web Services is in the AIR all around us then why cant we have policy demanding AI systems help ensure health? Healthy AI helps marginalized kids learn how to get dentist, or make decisions on life-styles to ensure their body is safe. Drug companies view safety as take a pill for a weekened bender to potentially transmitted disease. Fenway Health in Boston is pioneering use of tech to ask questions before a one night stand leading to long term health consequences, drug cocktails, and self decay. Safe, healthy humans, expanding consciousness, navigating digital sludge, and building resistance to social paradigms of decay  

- goals - Info Tech Teaching - theory, ethics, programming. spent half my life swiming in it now dedicate rest of life to delivering quality content to help train younger minds to inform decision making practices more deeply than provided through many school programs.

- Robots are here, we just cant see how many there are yet.  
- ----> Jobs are eroding. We need new systems for 'everything not robot' and a new generation learning how to responsibly think about it and ensure humans develop deeper 
- ---------->consciousness pillars versus over-exposure to AI dread, drug residuals, robotic sex dolls, and AI facsination leading to body and mind destruction.

-     -> (dec) NEW 1 hr daily study <probaility, statistics, and data using R> - Speegle + Clair (great refresher)
