>> Major LEX FRIDMAN fan. I would like to use his podcasts as a basis for expanding computer literacy.  
**Proud to make it to last interview round with Dr. Fridman <secretary position>.**  
**Unfortunately I was too slow on the timed tests and.or didn't fancy his brain's machine learning scoring**

## Question:
=> How will the new REAL.machines work with humans to compute the impossible at a critical moment?
Will Isaac Asimov's children drown?

Cooper (human)  
-- Get ready to match our spin with the retro-thrusters  

CASE (robot)  
-- It's not possible.  

Cooper 
-- No. It's necessary.
