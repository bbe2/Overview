👋 Hi, I’m bbe  - technical writer, research enthuasiat, robust data science training, love statitics Go CUSE !

- 👀 I’m interested in ... advancing health equity for marginalized youth through tech  

-- 👀- 👀  Adept building ontologies, informed with scientific research, to frame analysis + translate into structures  

-- 👀- 👀-  👀 ---> Love digital dust, dwell times, geolocations, content scatter, and nonsense  ✨✨  

-- 👀- 👀-- 👀- 👀 ---> deep practical re-engineering w complex machine + operations improvement, BOMs, prod goals ✨✨  

-- 👀- 👀-- 👀- 👀- ----> write, edit user manuals, complex user requirements, data diagraming, white papers, sow  

-- 👀- 👀-- 👀-- 👀- 👀✨----> training and developing staff to reach their potential  

-- 👀- 👀-- 👀- 👀- ...> Investigate new social paradigms, mechanisms of influence, simulacrum structures, and nascent indicators  

-- 👀- 👀--> Role models -> Leanrning Salon, Feep practical re-engineering w complex machine + operations improvement, BOMs, prod goals . Chollet, Chalmers,D. , Baudrillard, J., Ida Momennejad + John Langford (MSFT)  

-- 👀--> I’m currently learning ... REDcap! doing a nursing research project

- LEXisms  
- Need to expand understanding and scope of consciousness  
- beauty will save the world - Dostoevsky  
- is it more concerning for the lobster to be boiled or for lobster to be exploded with an m80  
- how important is spice in the dish you are making

- I have alwasy been driven to social and info theory. check out my sociology papers on postmodernism, ULTRA-modern, marxist dead labor  
- i left a masters in sociology bc of work out out state and no online or school near where I lived. I raised and trained horses and everything farm.

- in 2000 i wrote "all humans and systems are blended together through capitiamism's onslaught where computing tech taking control of the real. The real has been replaced by matrices, memory banks, command models, and operating systems functioning on intense levels of rationalization, perfect programming no human is alien from  
- Question: how can we use perfect programming + control of the real + AI to establish policies for HEALTHY-AI ?  

- If tech is now self-programming itself, has endless GPUs and storage, and Amazon Web Services is in the AIR all around us then why cant we have policy demanding AI systems help ensure health? Healthy AI helps marginalized kids learn how to get dentist, or make decisions on life-styles to ensure their body is safe. Drug companies view safety as take a pill for a weekened bender to potentially transmitted disease. Fenway Health in Boston is pioneering use of tech to ask questions before a one night stand leading to long term health consequences, drug cocktails, and self decay. Safe, healthy humans, expanding consciousness, navigating digital sludge, and building resistance to social paradigms of decay  

- goals - Info Tech Teaching - theory, ethics, programming. spent half my life swiming in it now dedicate rest of life to delivering quality content to help train younger minds to inform decision making practices more deeply than provided through many school programs.  

- Robots are here, we just cant see how many there are yet.  
- ----> Jobs are eroding. We need new systems for 'everything not robot' and a new generation learning how to responsibly think about it and ensure humans develop deeper 
- ---------->consciousness pillars versus over-exposure to AI dread, drug residuals, robotic sex dolls, and AI facsination leading to body and mind destruction.

-     -> What have I done? open TREE in resume folder for a high-level PROJECT VISUAL  
-     -> (dec) NEW 1 hr daily study <probaility, statistics, and data using R> - Speegle + Clair (great refresher)  
-    
- 💞️ Need collaboration help ? ...info theory, editing, data organizing - ask me
