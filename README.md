"finally i bear witness to the underlying spiritual realities that give meaning to these victims travails...Demonic foes presents examples from a larger body of such evidence concerning a subject area that is often misunderstood and ignored...I believe that the value of identifying and attending to the reality of this sobering topic is worth the effort and that its implications warrant reflection."
