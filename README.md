• check out my >_7.py.pillars course to help absorb python data objects and core programming skills  

👋  GOAL=> build a sustainable culture of programming energizing youth and adult learners in the art of the possible  
 >>>>          frame compute as a gateway to quality work, resilience, sustainability  

----------

a few pillars  
-- 👀-  Proven skills in partnering with leaders to intuit goals and ensure program learning objectives.   
-- 👀- 👀-->  Apply theory and learning principles to multimedia to achieve desired learning focus.   
-- 👀- 👀-- 👀 --> Promote an ontology of happiness and balance with all peers.  
-- 👀- 👀-- 👀-->  Do other people matter? Of course, tutoring a clinical associate to pass TEAS and start nursing school.  
-- 👀- 👀-- 👀-- 👀 --> Adept leadership and team communication while learning and developing quality technical assets.   
-- 👀- 👀-- 👀--> Need the complex explained? Rely on my keen grok skills to decipher, translate, and bridge content.   
-- 👀 --> Are there curious creatures on your team? Happy to share recent neuroscience literature learnings.
